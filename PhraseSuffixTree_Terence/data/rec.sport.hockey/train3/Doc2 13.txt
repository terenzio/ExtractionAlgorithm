Fig. 11. Goal-driven use case model of the course enrollment system.

to the guideline provided in Section 3.6, developers are encouraged to find the common property or crosscutting concerns in these two goals. They may find that an early aspect named "Construct Authentication Matrix" can be considered to crosscut these two goals to offer multiple levels of security level controls and various kinds of user roles. Consequently, a use case "Construct Authentication Matrix" can be added to realize the early aspect and denoted as EarlyAspectUAM : (Construct Authentication Matrix, [GIncreaseNetworkSecurity and GUserFunctionClassification ]). The rest of the early aspects discovered are listed as follows:          EarlyAspectMSHD : (Maintain System Historical Data, [GSystemManagemenr&Maintain , GViewableRecordLogs ]) EarlyAspectSII : (Support Interactive Inquiry, [GQ&A , GSystemStateDisplay ]) EarlyAspectUAM : (Construct Authentication Matrix, [GIncreaseNetworkSecurity , GUserFunctionClassification ]) EarlyAspectMEDI : (Maintain Enrollment Data Integrity, [GQueryStudentEnrollmentData , GStudentInfo:SelfMaintain , GVariousCourseInfo:Query ]) EarlyAspectSMTC : (Support Multiple Types of Courses, [GEnrollmentforOutsiders , GSummerEnrollment ]) EarlyAspectSUFI : (Support User Friendly Interface, [GSystemMainPage , GLatestNewsDisplay ]) EarlyAspectSFE : (Support Flexible Enrollment, GSummerCourseEnrollment , [GRegularEnrollment , GInterschoolEnrollment , GApplicationFormPrinting ]) EarlyAspectMCDI : (Maintain Course Data Integrity, GChangeCourseData , [GCourseDataManagement , GDSManageDepart:CourseInfo: ]) EarlyAspectMSS : (Maintain System Security, [GEnrollmentAvailableforStudents , GSystemLoginFunction ])

4.2 Experiment At the beginning of the experiment, a 30-minute lecture is given to the participants prior to conducting the experiment. The P and S groups are briefed with the concept of evaluating the relationships between goals and use cases, the usage of the ArgoUML-based supporting tool, and a summary of requirements statements of the NCU course enrollment system. The E group is briefed with the concept of early aspects along with guidelines for finding early aspects and a summary of requirements statements of the NCU course enrollment system along with the GDUC model of the system. The number of goal clusters identified by the P group and S group using GEA in the survey ranges from 2 to 20 with an average of 8.067 goal clusters, and the frequency of occurrence of goal clusters also varies from 11, 20, 33.3, 40, 66.7, 80, to 100 percent. Two indicators are established: goal-grouping-strength and aspect-crosscutting-modularity, to serve as a basis for further evaluating the proposal approach and for illustrating the benefits of our proposed approach. The goal-grouping-strength indicator is defined as the grouping strength between goals under different thresholds. By setting different thresholds from 0, 15, 30, 50, 75, to 100 percent (see Fig. 12), the grouping of goals still bears a similar pattern, that is, goals being grouped together under different thresholds usually will be grouped into clusters even though by different developers. For example, goals 3 and 4 are grouped for 17 to 21 times under different thresholds setting from 100 to 0 percent, which means that the proposed approach can provide a similar grouping results performed by various types of developers--college professors, programmers, or graduate students. Furthermore, the peaks in the graph
