This paper presents a framework for composing SOAP, RESTful, OSGi services, web contents and Android Activities. A BPEL engine is extended and bundled with adapters to enable the direct invocation and composition of SOAP, RESTful and OSGi services with heterogeneous content types: SOAP, JSON, YAML, Protocol Buffer and Java objects. Additionally, two transformation mechanisms are devised to enable the transformation of Web contents and Android activities that are two typical assets on mobile devices into OSGi services so as to be composed by the extended BPEL engine. We also conducted an experiment on a smart living control system to evaluate our approach. In our approach, the request and response messages of the invocations of RESTful services do not need to be transferred via server-side SOAP services. These messages are directly transferred in between the extended BPEL engine and the RESTful services. The experimental results show that our proposed approach generates less network traffic and spends less turnaround time than those of the traditional approaches. With the extended BPEL engine based on Adapter pattern, SOAP, non-SOAP and non-Web services can be integrated through a systematic way. Furthermore, the engine can be considered as a more suitable framework for composing heterogeneous services than the traditional ones from the perspective of resource consumptions in mobile environments.
