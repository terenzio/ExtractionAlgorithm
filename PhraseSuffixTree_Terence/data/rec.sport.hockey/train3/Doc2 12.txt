goal clustering. Although the dimensions of the two matrices may increase while the number of goals increases, the effort in computing the two matrices can be minimized comparing to the effort spent on each round of the bid in our previous work. Moreover, after each round of goal clustering, the dimensions of the two matrices decrease due to the grouping of goals and goal clusters, which further reduces the effort in computing the two matrices for the next round of goal clustering. For example, if there are n goals and each time there is only one highest similarity score in the clustering matrix, searching for the highest score in the matrix takes Oðn2 Þ and processing n goals requires OðnÞ, which results in a total of Oðn3 Þ time complexity by multiplying these two factors together. For the worst case scenario, there are ðn À 1Þ Ã ðn À 1Þ=2 highest similarity scores in the first clustering matrix and the dimensions of the clustering matrix will be reduced by one after each round of clustering, which gives us a total of Oðn!Þ time complexity for the worst case scenario. Comparing the proposed approach with our previous work, the time complexity for the worst case has been improved from Oðnn Þ to Oðn!Þ. No computation result can be obtained by applying our previous algorithm to the course enrollment system due to a large number of parallel nodes expansion. The supporting tool is also redesigned to integrate with an open source software modeling tool -- ArgoUML. MapReduce, and HBase are also incorporated into the ArgoUML-based supporting tool as a means to improve the performance of the proposed clustering process. Adopting MapReduce enhances the clustering algorithm by performing grouping procedures concurrently, and using HBase helps manage the storing of intermediate data and final results generated by Mappers during the grouping of goals.

discovers early aspects without using the GEA. Additionally, Mann-Whitney U-test [29] is performed to validate the results of the experiment to show that the difference between with GEA and without GEA is statistically significant. The reasons why we choose Mann-Whitney Utest are two-fold: one is that the data are not randomly drawn from a normally distributed population, and the other is that samples are independent.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

To illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach, a course enrollment system developed at National Central University in Taiwan is adopted in this section as a means to demonstrate how the proposed approach could advantage developers in the discovery of early aspects. By following the goaldriven early aspect process, goals are formulated for constructing GDUC model and goal clusters are classified by using the ArgoUML-based supporting tool to evaluate the relationships between goals and use cases. Early aspects are identified by following the 4-step guideline to identify early aspectual candidates obtained from goal clusters. In the process, developers can reduce the efforts in looking for crosscutting concerns or common properties across the whole system, and focus on relationships between goals and use cases for discovering early aspects. Furthermore, it better provides modularity insights in the analysis and design phases of software development by using the GDUC model. An experiment is conducted to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach by inviting three groups of people, including 15 college professors (P group), 15 graduate students (S group) and 15 software engineers from a software R&D institute in Taiwan (E group), to a survey: P and S groups apply the GEA to the course enrollment system to discover early aspects, while the E group

4.1 A Course Enrollment System In the experiment, a course enrollment system for the university is considered and a set of requirements and use cases are collected from the development team in the university computer center. The old version of the course enrollment system was built prior to the course information system, which made it cumbersome for the course enrollment system to retrieve or update course information correctly from or to the course information system. Therefore, modifications have to be made to the course enrollment system to make it robust to retrieve and update course information correctly. Furthermore, the old version of the course enrollment system did not support functionality, such as summer courses enrollment, inter-school enrollment, enrollment for adult education, enrollment for foreigner students, and query for parents to get enrollment information of their children. These are all new requirements to be included in the new version of the course enrollment system. Main requirements are summarized as follows: (1) to integrate the databases of course enrollment system and course information system; (2) to redesign the user interface of the system; (3) to provide enrollment functionality for summer courses, inter-university courses, adult education courses, and etc.; (4) to provide an access control mechanism according to user identity; and (5) to provide English user interface for the system. By applying the goal-driven early aspect process, 27 goals in the systems are identified and formulated by examining the description of the requirements. Based upon these goals, a goal-driven use case model of the course enrollment system is derived and constructed using the ArgoUML-based supporting tool (see Fig. 11). As a result, in the course enrollment system, nine goal clusters are obtained below:
         (GSystemManagement&Maintain , GViewableRecordLogs ) (GQ&A , GSystemStateDisplay ) (GIncreaseNetworkSecurity , GUserFunctionClassification ) (GQueryStudentEnrollmentData , GStudentInfo:SelfMaintain , GVariousCourseInfo:Query ) (GEnrollmentforOutsiders , GSummerEnrollment ) (GSystemMainPage , GLatestNewsDisplay ) (GRegularEnrollment , GSummerCourseEnrollment , GInterschoolEnrollment , GApplicationFormPrinting ) (GCourseDataManagement , GChangeCourseData , GDSManageDepart:CourseInfo: ) (GEnrollmentAvailableforStudents , GSystemLoginFunction )

Among these goal clusters, it is noted that all the occurrences are counted as 100 percent indicating that these goal clusters can be treated directly as the early aspectual candidates. For example, one of the goal clusters has two goals, GIncreaseNetworkSecurity and GUserFunctionClassification . According
