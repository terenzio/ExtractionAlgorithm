LEE AND HSU: GEA: A GOAL-DRIVEN APPROACH TO DISCOVERING EARLY ASPECTS

601

Our future research plan includes: (1) to transform early aspects identified in the requirements phase to aspect-oriented programming language; (2) to discover aspects through exploring relationships among classes and methods in source code; (3) to conduct software refactoring by removing bad aspect smells detected in the identified aspects; and (4) to establish an evaluation process for assessing the refactoring method.
