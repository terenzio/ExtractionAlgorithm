Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but I'm travelling, and if you could leave the call-in number for tomorrow's meeting on my voice mail, I'll be forever indebted.
Guys, FYI - Ben, can you follow up with this person with our interest or lack thereof whichever is applicable.
Guys, I will set up a monthly meeting between myself and you guys to discuss deal flow, priorities and strategy - I think you will find that more effective and I can keep the other meeting small.
Guys, please attend if available.
Have a look in your humidor tonight.
Have there been any more reactions to the presentation that McCullough made at the "volatility conference" in Portland last week?
He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.
Hey, I know it's a pain, but I think there would be value in getting together (if folks are available) on Thursday evening from 7-10 with (lots of) beer and pizza and grind through the finance case.
Hey, send them again.
Hi Maureen: Could you please make sure that Steve gets these?
Hi, please save this important email.

I am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to London.
I am sure this is a joke , but I dont get it.. Please explain - ANd I am doing fine - I am tired these days ( that age thing , you know).
I assume that you will go through these documents for benefits/plan issues and then send relevant ones to Pat this week.
I assume that you will have the Argentines to Brazil for the discussion and any one else you think appropriate.
I believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.
I believe we are scheduled to start at 900am Thursday.
I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next week.
I expect an answer by early next week -- I hope Monday.
I hate to bother you with this request because I realize you must be very busy; I was wondering if you had a chance to forward my resume to Ginger Gamble (at Reliant) and Carol Scherer (at Duke Energy).
I have attached for your review the letter requests from Northern to you and the e-mails which were traded back and forth from yourself and Argent.
I have cleared my calendar, so any time in the morning works for me.
I have you jacket in my car, so let me know what you want to do about that.

I just happened to be in Dave's email looking for something for him........I saw your name and thought maybe I'd better see if this was something I needed to put on his calendar.....As a rule, I do not go into Dave's email unless I am told or looking for something that someone has requested me to print and give to him.....so, if you need something to be put on his calendar, please copy me on it or chances are I may or may not find out about it...
I just wanted to know whether you still had time for a quick meeting.
I know you have been kind enough for the connection, I was wondering if you could help me find out if Mr. Heffner did receive them.
I look forward to continuing our discussions from 2000 on how we can be better together - I am committed to doing this the right way as I know you are.
I need this done this week if possible.
I need to know if you want to download this or if I should pass it on to another member...
I need what we discussed yesterday.
I shall spend more time looking at it over the weekend and if I see a problem I shall call you on Monday.
I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.
I suggest doing it in writing, rather than an email that could be manipulated.

I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.
I would greatly appreciate your help in resolving this issue as soon as possible.
I would like to get access to Mimic.
I would like to have this by Wednesday night in everyone's e-mail Thursday morning.
I would suggest that we try to set up a follow up meeting in early October once you have completed your work.
I would suggest that you find a day over the next couple weeks to meet Rob in Calgary to speak in detail about the role, the market and expectations.
I'd be happy to hear from you.

You guys could not work this out - so I offered a compromise position which involved a well coordinated test marketing iniative (this was agreed to by you and John at the offsite): a) the insurance group was to identify the initial 5 to 10 target customer list that ENA would pitch the product to which should give us a determination if this is a commercially viable product; b) John and Scott would facilitate the contact with the customers to ensure a consistent face and story with the customers - if you guys can sit down and come up with an alternative that works for you - great; regardless, John had promised me that he would do everything necessary to facilitate and promote this capability to these customers ASAP; c) both groups would put a deal team together and get out there ASAP; d) if the test marketing of the product is successful; I agree that we need to sit down and discuss how we formally allign the interests of these groups.
